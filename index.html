        I am heartily thankful to Prof. Dr. Mahesh G. Thakkar, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, K.S.K.V Kachchh University for his guidance. His constant supervision, suggestions and discussions at every stage have enriched my work.

        A special thanks goes to our seniors Mr. Anil Chavan, Mr. Abhishek Lakhote, Mr. Chirag Jani and Mr. Adarsh Thakkar who gave us a brief knowledge and made the experience even more fulfilling
